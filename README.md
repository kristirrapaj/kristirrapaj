- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kristirrapaj

  My name is Kristi, I am a 25 years old Albanian living overseas, in Tuscany, Italy!
  
I always like to keep myself occupied so I do a lot of things in my daily life; I work in a restaurant as a help chef and I study Game Programming in school.
I am a highly artistic person, or so I think. My hobbies include writing, cooking and drawing.
Even since I learnt how to hold a pencil, I started drawing. Today I do mostly digital art; specifically portraits. Drawing brings me joy in life and inspires me to feel and do better, so I try to do it as much as I can!

  My repo includes mainly school projects; games made in Unity with my teammates or research papers for finals.
Feel free to take a look and suggest me anything that comes into your mind.
